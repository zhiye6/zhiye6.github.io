                        Hi, my name is Zhi Ye and I'm a recent graduate from the University of Washington with degrees in
                        Informatics and Geography focused in product/project/program management and data analytics. I’m interested in working
                        with data and technology that’s in service of people and the environment. More specifically, I hope to pursue a career
                        in product management as I enjoy building products to solve customer needs. Outside of my professional interests, I 
                        like to weightlift, go on hikes, and explore new boba shops around Seattle.
