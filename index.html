                        Hi, my name is Zhi Ye and I'm a recent graduate from the University of Washington with degrees in
                        Informatics and Geography focused in data science. I’m interested in working with data and technology
                        that’s in service of people and the environment. More specifically, I hope to pursue a career in product
                        management or consulting as I enjoy creating products and solutions that solve customer needs. Outside of my
                        professional interests, I like to weightlift, go on hikes, and explore new boba shops around Seattle.
