# GEOG 258 Digital Geographies:
* Developed hands-on skills for digital mapping and data management; integrated diverse visual, textual and quantitative data; and critically assessed the societal implications of new spatial technologies.
*	Explored how digital technologies produce social and spatial relationships, geographic knowledge, inequality and empowerment, inclusion, exclusion, and dispossession.

#### GEOG 360 GIS and Mapping:
*	Gained knowledge and experience on current options in geospatial technologies, using online mapping platforms such as ESRI ArcGIS Online, and using desktop mapping platforms such as ESRI ArcMap.
*	Developed a conceptual understanding of cartographic, mapping, and ethical principles; utilized geovisualization and geospatial analysis techniques to make arguments and tell stories with maps.

#### INFO 370 Data Science Methods:
*	Analyzed the ecosystem of data science, the data science process, and ethical issues within the field.
*	Utilized python for data science tasks such as cleaning and reshaping medium-sized datasets, processing non-numeri data, and interpreting simple analysis/machine learning methods including regressions and nearest neighbors’ methods.

## Work Experience

**Kim Bowl Restaurant & Lounge (2012 - 2016)**
*	Conducted demographic research to help create a new menu for my family’s Chinese restaurant to suit the palate of the ethnic composition in Longview, WA.
*	My day-to-day tasks includes sitting customers, taking orders, bussing, cash registering, and providing exceptional customer service to ensure my customers have an enjoyable dining experience.


## Projects

#### Coffee Culture in Seattle
*	Utilizing ESRI’s ArcGIS, I created a story map journal that narrates the Coffee Culture in Seattle. The purpose of the story map is to provide insight about Seattle’s coffee culture and the welcoming community that puts great effort in producing the highest quality of coffee and customer experience.

#### Mapping Breast Cancer Mortality in the US
*	Using ArcMap, I mapped breast cancer mortality rates and mortality rate ratio between ethnic groups in the US. Afterwards, I performed a hot spot analysis to map where the mortality rates are highest.

#### Wisconsin Breast Cancer Classification
*	Working with the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, I created a summary table to showcase statistics for each variable in the dataset. Subsequently, I analyzed numerous logistic regression models and its accuracy and F-score to determine the diagnosis based on the data is either malignant or benign.
