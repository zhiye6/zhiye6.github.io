<em>Bachelor of Science in Informatics: Data Science & Bachelor of Arts in Geography: Data Science</em>

#### INFO 430 Database Design and Management:
*   Developed hands-on skills for relational and entity-relationship models, programmed SQL statements for querying and modifying data, designed three-tier architectures, and utilized ACID properties.
*   Designed databases with snowflake/star schema with X tables and Y views.
*   Wrote DML and DDL statements with indexing, table compression and permissions model to build a secure, scalable and reliable database.

#### INFO 371 Advanced Methods in Data Science:
*	Utilized python to clean and reshape medium-sized datasets, conducted exploratory analysis for feature selection, and selected X features with high correlation to target variable based on p-values.
*	Performed feature engineering, evaluated features, and developed an NN model with X% accuracy/X% coherence score.
*   Built regression models that explained X% variance of the data with Y features.

#### CSE 163: Intermediate Data Programming
*	Built a search engine using the TF-IDF algorithm to compute relevancy of a document to a given term.
*   Processed CSV’s and datasets to perform analysis using Python, Pandas, Geopandas, and Matplotlib.

## Projects

#### Healthcare Database
*	Led a team of 4 to design and develop a Healthcare Database that allows users to store and query information regarding the hospital, staff, appointments, etc. Wrote DDL and DML statements to build and test with synthetic transactions (hundreds of thousands) to ensure the capabilities of the database.

#### Wisconsin Breast Cancer Classification
*	Analyzed and cleaned the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. Extracted specific variables such as diagnosis, concpoints.mean, fracdim.mean, etc. to analyze numerous logistic regression models.
*   Computed accuracy and F-score on models to predict whether the diagnosis is malignant or benign.

#### Predicting Adult Income That Will Exceed $50,000 per Year
*   Performed data cleaning and supervised machine learning via decision tree and nearest neighbor.
*   Computed statistics of adults with income greater than $50,000, income inequality across gender for varying occupations, income of adults for varying education, and created visualizations using plotly.
*   Integrated testing throughout the project to ensure functions were outputting correct values and results.
